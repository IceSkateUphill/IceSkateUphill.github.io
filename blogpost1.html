<h1>Chapter 1: Jacob Linneman</h1>
<p> When thinking about software development, there are a lot of properties that the public associate with the process that, 
    when given more than a passing thought, appear ludicrous.  One that is highlighted well in that chapter is the notion that 
    software has a specific standard it is striving for instead of it being an evolution.  The chapter talks this over in the 
    “Good-Enough Software” section.  </p>
<p> Here, the author warns us of how being too focused on what the best thing we can make, often leaves a developer disappointed 
    in what they do end up finishing.  Because, let’s face it, it is almost never the case where we have the resources to create 
    what can be the absolute best that our software calls for.  Instead, it is more beneficial for us to make what we can useful 
    to those that will use, maintain, and overview our code.  Good-enough has this connotation that what you made isn’t up to snuff, 
    that it is only the lowest passable work that you can do to get by.  But, when we look at it in the lens of development cycles, 
    good-enough becomes a successful product, and there is nothing to be ashamed of if it is successful.</p>
